This project features a Windows Forms application designed to calculate and display the training heart rate based on user input.
The application incorporates modular functions to handle user input, perform calculations, and present the results in a user-friendly manner.

I demonstrate the modular structure of a C# application for calculating training heart rates. It includes three functions:

UserInput: Accepts user input for age and resting heart rate.
CalculateRate: Computes the training heart rate using the input parameters.
DisplayRate: Displays the calculated training heart rate in the application interface.
